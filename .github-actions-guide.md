# GitHub Actions Status

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Here's what gets tested:

## Status Badges

[![Tests](https://github.com/pycoddiy/typing_bot/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pycoddiy/typing_bot/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![Code Quality](https://github.com/pycoddiy/typing_bot/workflows/Code%20Quality/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pycoddiy/typing_bot/actions/workflows/quality.yml)

## Workflows

### Tests (`tests.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Every push and pull request
- **Python versions**: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **What it does**:
  - Installs dependencies with uv
  - Runs pre-commit checks
  - Executes pytest test suite (92 tests)
  - Generates coverage reports
  - Uploads coverage to Codecov (Python 3.11 only)

### Code Quality (`quality.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Push/PR to main branches
- **Python version**: 3.11
- **What it does**:
  - Runs all pre-commit hooks
  - Performs type checking with mypy
  - Security scanning with bandit

## Local Testing

To run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run all pre-commit checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run tests
pytest -v

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
coverage html  # Creates htmlcov/ directory
```

## Matrix Testing

The test workflow runs on multiple Python versions to ensure compatibility:
- Python 3.9 (oldest supported)
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11 (main development version)
- Python 3.12 (newest)

## Coverage Reporting

Coverage reports are generated on Python 3.11 and uploaded to Codecov for tracking test coverage over time.

## Troubleshooting CI

If GitHub Actions fail:

1. **Pre-commit failures**: Run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally first
2. **Test failures**: Run `pytest -v` locally to see detailed output
3. **Type check failures**: Run `mypy --ignore-missing-imports *.py` locally
4. **Security issues**: Run `bandit -r .` locally to see security warnings

The CI environment mirrors your local development setup, so issues that pass locally should pass in CI.
